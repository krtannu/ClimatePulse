ClimatePulse
Project Overview
ClimatePulse is an intuitive platform designed to help farmers and local agricultural communities share real-time, localized weather reports. By collecting and aggregating user-submitted weather data, ClimatePulse aims to improve weather forecasts for rural areas and empower farmers to make informed agricultural decisions. The platform also provides a community space for users to discuss weather conditions and share best practices.
